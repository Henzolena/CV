                    During my studies, I've also worked on several academic projects that showcase my abilities to
                    collaborate,
                    lead, and innovate.
                    For instance, I worked with a team of two to develop an e-commerce website, added pages, catalog,
                    and
                    shopping
                    cart functionality while setting up and configuring EC2 and Route 53 from AWS.
                    I also took part in a team of 10 to build a 2D game using Unity by implementing the gameplay
                    mechanics
                    and
                    functionality of the game using C#.
                    I led the team by providing direction and vision for the project and ensured that the project met
                    the
                    defined
                    goals and objectives.

            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Summer 2022</td>
                <td>
                    Additionally, I collaborated with a team of five members to compare the differences between MongoDB
                    and
                    MySQL
                    databases by creating an application that performs CRUD functions.
                    As part of another team, I developed a functional To-do list app using Java, implementing data
                    storage
                    using
                    SQLite databases and combining roles of back-end developer and user interface developer.
                    I also designed and managed the development of a weather app using Java, taking on the roles of UX
                    designer and
                    program manager in a team of 10. The app is capable of displaying current weather conditions and
                    forecasts for a
                    given location by integrating with APIs to retrieve and integrate data from a weather service

    <h3> Work Experiences</h3>
    <p>
        Before my graduation, I gained valuable work experience as a Computer Specialist at EECC in Austin, Texas, where
        I repaired and installed computer hardware and software on an average of 15 computers per week.
        I also trained staff members and volunteers on computer usage, resulting in increased productivity and a
        decrease in IT support requests.
        Additionally, I've been working as a self-employed Web Developer since January 2018, where I've developed
        user-friendly and visually appealing websites using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML languages.
        I've also worked as a back-end developer, connecting HTML to databases with MySQL using PHP to facilitate the
        communication between the front-end of the website and the back-end data storage.
